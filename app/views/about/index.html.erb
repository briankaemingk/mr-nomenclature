<p>Ever since he was a kid, he's been naming things. He snickers at <a href="#">shitty names</a>. He scoffs at <a href="#">famous</a> <a href="#">misnomers</a>. He picked the perfect name for your daughter before she was conceived, and then he picked a name for for the inferior name you picked. He doesn't have to convince you that names matter, because you know that. You've been spelling out your god-awful name your whole life. Mr Nomenclature lives in the Internet in a little town called Names at the intersection of Art Ave and Science St. Before you name something, before you name <em>anything</em>, you should pay him a visit.</p>
