### Mr Nomenclature names [*children, bands, sex acts, plays, articles, houses, essays*] things. ###

Ever since he was a kid, he's been naming things.  He snickers at [shitty names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Armey). He scoffs at [famous](http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/one-worlds-biggest-firms-accidentally-changes-name-gay-underwear-mag090713/) [misnomers](http://www.snopes.com/business/misxlate/nova.asp).  He picked the perfect name for your daughter before she was conceived, and then he picked a name for for the inferior name you picked.  He doesn't have to convince you that names matter, because you know that.  You've been spelling out your god-awful name your whole life.  Mr Nomenclature lives in the Internet in a little town called Names at the intersection of Art Ave and Science St.  Before you name something, before you name *anything*, you should pay him a visit.
